Attempting to span more columns than are defined.

## Description

An element has been assigned to span more columns than have been defined.

In the example below, the `TextBlock` has been assigned to the second column and told to span that column and the next. This requires that 3 columns are defined but only 2 columns definitions exist.

```xml
<Grid>
    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*">
        <ColumnDefinition Width="*">
    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

    <TextBlock
        Text="Hello World"
        Grid.Column="1"
        Grid.ColumnSpan="2">
</Grid>
```

## Why this is suggested

The use of undefined columns can lead to unexpected layout behavior.
It can also be confusing for other people looking at the code.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add missing column definitions.'
This will add column definitions for what has been assigned.
If no column definitions are currently assigned then a `Grid.ColumnDefinitions` element will be added. If there are already some column definitions defined, additional column will be added at the end.

After additional column definitions have been added, you may need to adjust their widths according to your need.
