`Name` should begin with an upper case character.

## Description

The value specified for the `Name` or `x:Name` property should not start with a lower case letter.

## Why this is suggested

Having a consistent naming convention helps with understanding the code.
Capitalizing the first letter of the `Name` follows the convention in other code.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Capitalize first letter of Name.'
This will capitalize the first letter of the Name value.

After the property is altered, you will need to manually adjust the use of the value elsewhere in your code.
