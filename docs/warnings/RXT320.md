# RXT310

`Image` source filename may not work on all platforms.

Applies to **Xamarin.Forms** only!

## Description

An `Image` has been added to the document and the `Source` property set to a local filename but that may not work on all platforms.

## Why this is suggested

Android drawables have strict naming restrictions. The filename being used breaks these restrictions and so you won't be able to use the same filename for all platforms.

## How to address the issue

Use a filename that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, underscore, and period.
