# RXT301

Password `Entry` does not have a `MaxLength` specified.

Applies to **Xamarin.Forms** only!

## Description

An `Entry` has been added to the document and the `IsPassword` property set to `True`, but the `MaxLength` property has not been specified.

## Why this is suggested

It is a general recommendation to include a maximum length for password capture.
While short passwords are not recommended, allowing entry of infinite length can lead to a bad user experience. It has also been known to be a security attack vector when the password is checked or passed to another system for validation.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add MaxLength property.'

Adjust the default value added based on what is appropriate for your app.
