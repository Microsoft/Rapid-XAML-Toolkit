# RXT331

`Slider` has `ThumbColor` specified but `ThumbImageSource` takes precedence.

Applies to **Xamarin.Forms** only!

## Description

The `ThumbColor` and `ThumbImageSource` properties are mutually exclusive.

## Why this is suggested

If both properties are set, the `ThumbImageSource` property will take precedence.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Remove attribute.'
