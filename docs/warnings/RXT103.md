Attempting to span more rows than are defined.

## Description

An element has been assigned to span more rows than have been defined.

In the example below, the `TextBlock` has been assigned to the second row and told to span that row and the next. This requires that 3 rows are defined but only 2 row definitions exist.

```xml
<Grid>
    <Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <RowDefinition Height="*">
        <RowDefinition Height="*">
    </Grid.RowDefinitions>

    <TextBlock
        Text="Hello World"
        Grid.Row="1"
        Grid.RowSpan="2">
</Grid>
```

## Why this is suggested

The use of undefined rows can lead to unexpected layout behavior.
It can also be confusing for other people looking at the code.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add missing row definitions.'
This will add row definitions for what has been assigned.
If no row definitions are currently assigned then a `Grid.RowDefinitions` element will be added. If there are already some row definitions defined, additional ones will be added at the end.

After additional row definitions have been added, you may need to adjust their heights according to your need.
