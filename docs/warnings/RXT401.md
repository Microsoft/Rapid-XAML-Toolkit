# RXT401

Handle both `Checked` and `Unchecked` events for a `CheckBox`.

## Description

The `Checked` and `Unchecked` events occur independently. If you handle these events, you should handle both of them to respond to state changes in the check box.

## Why this is suggested

The `CheckBox` is only handling one of the `Checked` or `UnChecked` events.
If handling one of these events it should handle both.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add missing event.'
This will add the missing event and give it an inferred event name.

After the property is added to the element, you will need to add an event handler.
