# RXT351

`ImageButton` lacks accessibility consideration.

Applies to **Xamarin.Forms** only!

## Description

An `ImageButton` has been added to the document but has no information available to accessibility tools to describe the button or what pressing it will do.

## Why this is suggested

People may use your app who are unable to view or understand the image in the button. Adding some text that can be read by a screen-reader is a simple step you can do to make your app more inclusive.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Add automation description.'

Ensure you provide a suitable name or description for the button and test with a screen-reader or similar tool.
