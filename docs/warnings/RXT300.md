# RXT300

`Keyboard` is not specified for the `Entry`.

Applies to **Xamarin.Forms** only!

## Description

An `Entry` has been added to the document but the `Keyboard` property has not been specified.

## Why this is suggested

Not specifying the most appropriate `Keyboard` can make it harder for users to enter the desired information. This is particularly true if they are not using a device with a physical keyboard.
Even if you want the "Default" value for this property, you are suggested to specify this to make it clear to others who look at the code that this you have considered what is the most appropriate option for the data being captured.

## How to address the issue

Press `Ctrl + .` and use the suggested action 'Specify Keyboard property.'

Ensure you are using the most appropriate `Keyboard` for the information you are trying to capture.
